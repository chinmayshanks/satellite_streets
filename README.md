# satellite_streets
A helping tool for checking OSM edit status.

Demo: http://chinmayms.com/satellite-streets/

###H3 USAGE
You will need a working MapBox app token. You can create one here: https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/
Once you have the token, edit js/app.js and assign the token value to the 'token' var.

This app is built using Leaflet and uses https://github.com/smeijer/L.GeoSearch + https://github.com/digidem/leaflet-side-by-side.
